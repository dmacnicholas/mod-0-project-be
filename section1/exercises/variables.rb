# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = 'Harry Potter'
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = 'Dobby'
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
warning = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
p warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = 24
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 20
p students



# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = 'Drew'
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 0
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets


# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# For first name I used a string since this had alpha characters for is_hungry I used a 
# boolean since you can only be hungry or not hungry as an option and for # of pets I used
# an integer since it has to be a whole number



# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = 'Henry'
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 7
p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
p healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks


#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?
# Yes and it looks correct and what I would expect
