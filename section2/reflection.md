## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

    - SMART goals is something that definitely resonated with me. Coding overall is very daunting and there are so many things I can learn. I believe by having more clear and specific goals that will help me start picking up concepts quicker.
    - Seeking help from others is another big thing that stuck out to me. I want to grow as a developer as long as I am working as a software developer and I will need to continue to rely on others throughout my journey as a software developer. This can be a challenge in a remote setting so I need to push myself to reach out more.


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

    I do believe that my coding skills can improve with effort and practice as that is how I have been able to get better at other things in my life.
    Iterating and reflection will be an area where I can improve on. I usually just move on to the next thing that comes up.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

    Conditionals are formed using a combination of if statements and logical operators
      - if
      - elsif
      - else
      

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

    You would want to use an if-statement if you want to determine at least two different outcomes based on a variable scenario input. It helps determine if something is true or false and based on that it will have an output.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  ```
  if variable == blah
    puts "whatever"
  else
    puts "everything"
  end
  ```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  You add in elsif in the statement.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
  ```
  age = 21

  if age = 21
    puts "First time to go to the bar!"
  elsif age < 21
    puts "Stay home and play video games!"
  else
    puts "Do whatever you want you are an adult!"
  end
  ```
